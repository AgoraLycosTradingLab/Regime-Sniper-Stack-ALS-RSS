run Regime Sniper Stack(ALS-RSS) in the following order:
1. Alpha R1 Macro Indicator 
2. Entropy Regime Scanner 
3. Stock Entropy Regime Scanner 
4. PII Stock Scanner 
5. RMVF Technical Scanner

1. Alpha R1 macro indicator:
The Alpha R1 Macro Indicator output provides a daily, top-down market state snapshot. It reports:
Regime label (Risk-On, Risk-Off, or Transition) derived from a composite risk score
Confidence level indicating how decisive the regime signal is
Active vs. inactive factor families to guide downstream models
Diagnostics showing raw macro signals (equity trend, VIX level/trend, credit, rates, USD, oil) and their normalized component scores
An optional CSV export for logging and model integration
This output is designed to act as a macro gate for factor activation and risk sizing in the broader stack.

2. Entropy Regime Scanner:
The Entropy Regime Scanner output summarizes volatility conditions and actionable setups across the scanned ETF universe. It reports:
Volatility regime signals identifying assets in low-entropy states, where forward price movement has historically expanded
Regime diagnostics including today’s entropy, regime threshold, and historical lift statistics
Bucket classification for each symbol (OVERLAP, PULLBACK_ONLY, BREAKOUT_ONLY, NO_BUY) based on trend, pullback, and breakout logic
Ranked tables highlighting the highest-conviction buy candidates and top historical entropy regimes
This output serves as a magnitude-based risk and opportunity filter ahead of execution layers.

| Bucket                       | Typical Hold            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **OVERLAP**                  | 1–5 trading days        |
| **BREAKOUT_ONLY**            | 3–10 trading days       |
| **PULLBACK_ONLY**            | 2–7 trading days        |
| **Vol-regime only (NO_BUY)** | Observation / prep only |


3. Stock Entropy Regime Scanner 
Select the universe SP500, Nasdaq, or ETFs.  Select Marketcap and Sector filters
The Stock Entropy Regime Scanner (SERS) output provides an equity-level volatility and setup map. It reports:
Today’s entropy regime signals showing stocks currently in low-entropy (compression) states
A recent-entropy gate (last N days) that determines whether setups remain tradable, reducing timing miss risk
Liquidity-filtered results (ADV20 in USD) to ensure institutional tradability
Bucket classifications (OVERLAP, PULLBACK_ONLY, BREAKOUT_ONLY, NO_BUY) used for trade selection and watchlists
Lift statistics and diagnostics ranking stocks by historical volatility expansion following low-entropy regimes
This output bridges regime detection and execution by narrowing the universe to liquid, regime-aligned stock setups.

| Bucket                        | Intended Hold |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| **OVERLAP**                   | ~3–7 days     |
| **BREAKOUT_ONLY**             | ~5–15 days    |
| **PULLBACK_ONLY**             | ~3–10 days    |
| **WATCHLIST (recent regime)** | Monitor only  |


4. PII Stock Scanner 
Select the universe SP500, Nasdaq, or ETFs.  Select Marketcap and Sector filters
The PII Stock Scanner output delivers a clean, execution-ready signal set. It reports:
A BUY SIGNAL table listing stocks that pass the Pullback Integrity Index threshold and all risk filters, confirmed by an EMA20 cross
Key diagnostics per stock (PII score, trend status, pullback depth, ATR%, volume relative strength) to validate setup quality
A ranked watchlist of trend-aligned stocks with elevated PII that have not yet triggered an entry
An error log for symbols skipped due to data or liquidity issues
This output is designed to surface high-integrity pullback entries while filtering out noise and late-stage extensions.

PII Holding Window (Operational Reality)
Primary window
3–7 trading days
This is where PII has its highest expectancy
Upper bound (if everything goes right)
10–15 trading days
Only when momentum expands immediately after entry
Failure window
1–3 days
If price stalls or rolls over, the signal has already failed

5. RMVF Technical Scanner
Select the universe SP500, Nasdaq, or ETFs.  Select Marketcap and Sector filters
The RMVF Technical Scanner output provides a final, execution-focused validation layer. It reports:
A pass/fail decision for each stock based on a multi-signal technical score
A composite score (out of 7) summarizing alignment across RSI, MACD, EMA trend, VWAP slope, Fibonacci reaction, ATR expansion, and volume confirmation
A ranked winners list showing only stocks that meet or exceed the minimum score threshold
Detailed diagnostics indicating which technical conditions passed or failed for transparency
A CSV export of full results for review, logging, or downstream execution
This output acts as the final confirmation gate before trade entry.
